Dear Harsh,  

You are truly a kind-hearted and good-natured person, and as your friend, I admire so many things about you. However, I feel it’s important to share something with you that’s been on my mind because I genuinely care about your success and well-being. Lately, I’ve noticed that you tend to give too much priority to girls, which sometimes comes across as a distraction from the things that really matter, like your studies and personal growth. While there’s nothing wrong with being friendly or sociable, it’s equally important to treat everyone with respect and maintain a positive outlook towards them. Harsh, I believe you have immense potential to achieve great things, but to do that, you need to focus your energy on your goals and ambitions. Education and self-improvement will set the foundation for the bright future you deserve, and I’d love to see you channel your amazing qualities towards becoming the best version of yourself.  

Always here to support you,  
Your friend.
